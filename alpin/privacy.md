PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.
BY USING THE SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW), YOU ARE AGREEING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, INCLUDING THE COLLECTION, USE AND SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION AND DATA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR THE RELATED TERMS OF USE, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OF THE SERVICES.
This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Alpin (”Alpin,” “we,” “us” or “our”), including the types of information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such collection, use and disclosure.
## Types of Information We Collect About You
There are two basic types of information that can be collected: personally identifiable information (PII) and non-personally identifiable information (Non-PII).  PII consists of any information that can be used to specifically identify you as an individual, whereas Non-PII consists of activity or aggregate information that does not reveal your identity.
We do not collect PII. We collect the following categories of information:
Location information when you use our applications, including location information either provided by a mobile device interacting with our application, or associated with your IP address, where we are permitted by law to process this information or have your permission.
Usage, viewing and technical data when you use our applications, including your device identifier or IP address, and date and time of application use.
## How We Collect Your Information
Information You Provide. We collect information you provide to us when interact with us. The information we collect is covered by this Privacy Policy and the information that any third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform's privacy practices. Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our applications.
Information Collected Automatically. When you access the application, we collect certain technical information in order to analyze the usage.
## How We Use Your Information
We may use information we collect about you to:
Provide you with products, services and information you requested (e.g., location-based services).
Provide you with customer support.
Send you notices about updates to the application.
Send you push notifications when you are using our apps. If you do not want these notifications, you can manage your preference through your device or app settings depending on your device type.
## Children’s Privacy
Children under the age of 13 should not use our Services at any time. Alpin does not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13.
## International Transfer of Data
Alpin is based in the United States and may from time to time transfer your personal information to other countries and make it accessible to any of our affiliates and third party service providers internationally. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including personal information, may be transferred to, and processed, stored and used in the United States. Under United States law, your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts or law enforcement in the United States.
By using our Services and providing your personal information to us, you understand and agree that your personal information may be sent to other countries including those which do not provide an equivalent level of information protection as the European Economic Area (EEA).
## Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
